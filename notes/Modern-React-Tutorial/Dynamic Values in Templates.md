- Content currently hard-coded
	- String "App Component"
- But we can move that to a variable, e. g. `title`
	- Include the value of variables in the generated HTML by
		- Enclosing the variable in curly braces; e. g., `{ title }`
- If one wants to output a variable whose value is an integer
	- Same thing: `{ lines }`
	- One can surround the curly braces with text
		- `Liked { likes } times`
		- React will "splice" the value of the variable, `likes`, into the string to replace `{ likes }`
- Attempting to render a Javascript object to the page **fails**
	- Message: "Objects are not valid as a React child..."
- One can render values of type:
	- `Integer`
	- `String`
	- `Array`
	- Javascript expressions that evaluate to one of the previous types
- In addition, one can use Javascript values as HTML **attributes**
	- For example, `<a href={ link }>Google Site</a>`
